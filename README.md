### Retrospective Meetings 
Here's a sample script I have used to start my retrospective meetings. It takes about 2 minutes to deliver and I have found it effective in warming up the discussion, laying out the ground rules and setting expectations.          
Also, I take notes on screen and frequently ask people to review my note and advise if it didn't capture their point.

Hello everyone, thanks for making time to join in the “INSERT PROJECT TITLE” retrospective meeting.        
This was a project lead by "DEV PARTIES" teams with the goal to serve "STAKE HOLDERS" teams.       

Before we start, I'd like to share a few words about retrospective meeting in case it’s been a while since you attended one of these:        
The goal of retrospective is to:      
- Celebrate job well done,      
- Identify the mishaps,     
- Commit to improve going forward.        

Retrospectives are an integral part of Agile methodology in building an “inspect and adapt” habit in teams.      

From experience, it is often helpful to also remind ourselves what retrospectives are NOT!       
1) This is not a place to justify the reasons why an action or decision was made the way it was.      
2) Comments that are shared in this meeting are not judgements nor criticisms. They are observations through the many lenses each of us hold.      

So really our goal here is to learn from the past while keeping our minds focused on improving the future.      

Now a small note on my role here, I’ll be:     
- Facilitating the flow of the conversation, 
- Keeping us on time and on task,
- Taking notes that capture the discussion such that in a few months when we review our progress, they resonate.


I’ll pause here in case there are any questions…
